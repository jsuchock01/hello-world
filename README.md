# hello-world
Repository to review examples of Python code as instructed in Lesson 23 of LPTHW

Just trying to learn enough programming languages to better manipulate data for use in statistical analysis.
If I knew what I was getting into when this whole process began, not sure I'd have taken it on.
But at this point, it is what it is.  And just trying to learn as quickly as possible.  Seems like a
rabbit hole that never ends.  But every now and then, I realize how far I've come.  And that's rewarding.
On the flip side, unfortunately, I realize much more frequently how far I have to go.  What are you gonna do?
